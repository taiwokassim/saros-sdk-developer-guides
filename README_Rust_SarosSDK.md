# Saros SDK (Rust)

This repository provides a **Rust implementation** of the Saros SDK, designed for developers integrating with the Saros ecosystem. It includes essential functions, usage examples, and integration patterns for building decentralized applications.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Built with **Rust** for safety and performance.
- Provides **APIs** to interact with Saros ecosystem components.
- Includes **examples** and **tests** (to be expanded).
- Structured for easy integration in dApps or services.

---

## 📦 Installation

Ensure you have **Rust** installed. If not, install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Clone this repository and build the SDK:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/saros-sdk-rust.git
cd saros-sdk-rust
cargo build
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

Import the SDK crate into your Rust project by adding it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
saros-sdk = { path = "../saros-sdk-rust" }
```

### Example

```rust
use saros_sdk::client::SarosClient;

fn main() {
    let client = SarosClient::new("https://api.saros.finance");
    match client.get_balance("user_wallet_address") {
        Ok(balance) => println!("Balance: {}", balance),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error fetching balance: {:?}", e),
    }
}
```

---

## 🛠️ Testing

To run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

> ⚠️ Note: Full error handling and edge cases are still being implemented.

---

## 📖 Documentation

You can generate docs locally:

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

---

## 🔑 Quality Standards

- All code examples must be tested against **current SDK versions**.
- Clear, concise writing optimized for developer workflow.
- Proper **error handling** and **edge case coverage** in examples.
- Environment setup instructions and prerequisites included.

---

## 📌 Roadmap

- [ ] Expand example coverage.
- [ ] Add error handling for all SDK functions.
- [ ] Integration tests with live Saros API.
- [ ] Publish to [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
