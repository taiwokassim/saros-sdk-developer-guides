# Saros SDK Developer Guides

This repository contains a **comprehensive set of tutorials and documentation** for working with the Saros SDKs.  
It is built as part of the **Saros SDK Guide Challenge** to provide developers with clear, step-by-step instructions on how to integrate, use, and extend Saros SDK modules in their own Solana projects.  

## 📖 What’s Inside

This repo brings together tutorials for every major Saros SDK component:

- **Saros AMM SDK** – How to integrate automated market making (AMM) into your dApps.  
- **Saros DLMM SDK** – Step-by-step guide for using Saros’s Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM).  
- **Saros Staking SDK** – How to set up staking programs, connect wallets, and interact with staked assets.  
- **Saros Farming SDK** – Tutorials on creating and managing farming pools, rewards, and incentives.  
- **Rust SDK** – A developer-oriented guide for using the Rust SDK with practical examples.  

Each section is detailed, with code snippets, workflows, and explanations to help developers go from **zero to fully functional integration**.  

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

1. **Lower the barrier of entry** for developers exploring the Saros ecosystem.  
2. Provide **hands-on, example-driven tutorials** for every SDK.  
3. Serve as a **single source of reference** for AMM, DLMM, staking, farming, and Rust development.  
4. Help accelerate the growth of the Saros developer community.
